Codewars, leetcode, etc.

This repository serves as as log for coding challenges. 


Challenges will be formated to the template set below:

// Prompt X -- The question, challenge, and/or puzzle.

// Solution X -- My written code in an attempt to solve the prompt. May use an initial pre-filled code provided in the prompt, if it is intended to be used. There may be multiple solutions I may write, and will be written out in their seperate sections (Solution 1, Solution 2, etc.)

// Test Code -- Provided either from the prompt or written by me.
